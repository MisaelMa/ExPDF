defmodule Pdf.Reader.Errors do
  @moduledoc """
  Documents the full reason set returned in `{:error, reason}` from `Pdf.Reader`.

  This module exports nothing — it is documentation only. Errors are bare atoms
  or `{atom, details}` tuples returned in `{:error, _}`; they are NOT exception
  structs. Pattern-match on them directly.

  ## Reason reference

  - `:not_a_pdf` — file or binary does not begin with `%PDF-`.
  - `{:unsupported_pdf_version, "X.Y"}` — version string is outside the
    1.0–2.0 range that this reader handles.
  - `:malformed` — generic spec violation when no structured detail is
    available (e.g., truncated binary before `%%EOF`).
  - `{:malformed, where, details}` — structured violation; `where` is one of
    `:trailer | :xref | :object | :stream | :content_stream | :cmap`;
    `details` is a map with at least `:offset` and `:expected` keys.
  - `:encrypted_password_required` — PDF is encrypted; no password was supplied
    (or the empty password was tried and rejected). Caller should retry with
    `Pdf.Reader.open(bin, password: "the_password")`.
  - `:encrypted_wrong_password` — password was supplied but authentication
    failed for both user and owner paths.
  - `:encrypted_unsupported_handler` — the PDF uses an encryption handler that
    is not the Standard Security Handler (`/Filter` is not `/Standard`), or the
    `/V` version is unsupported (not in `{1, 2, 4, 5}`), or V5 with R=5
    (deprecated Acrobat X beta), or V1/V2 was requested on a runtime where
    `:rc4` is absent from `:crypto.supports(:ciphers)` (e.g., OpenSSL 3.x
    FIPS mode).
  - `:io_error` — file read failed without a POSIX detail.
  - `{:io_error, posix}` — file read failed; `posix` is a `File.posix()`
    atom such as `:enoent` or `:eacces`.
  - `{:unsupported_filter, name}` — stream filter not in the supported set
    {FlateDecode, ASCII85Decode, ASCIIHexDecode, RunLengthDecode, LZWDecode};
    `name` is an atom.
  - `{:unresolved_ref, {n, g}}` — indirect reference `n g R` is absent from
    the cross-reference table or points past end-of-file.
  - `{:cmap_unsupported_subset, op}` — CMap stream uses a construct outside
    the `bfchar`/`bfrange` subset that this reader handles; `op` is an atom.
  - `{:lzw_decode_error, kind}` — LZW bit stream is malformed; `kind` is an
    atom describing the failure (e.g., `:code_out_of_range`, `:premature_eod`).
  - `{:flate_decode_error, kind}` — `:zlib` returned an error; `kind` is the
    zlib error term.
  - `{:objstm_unsupported, kind}` — object stream (`/Type /ObjStm`) is
    malformed or refers to a nested ObjStm (illegal per spec).
  - `:no_pages` — page tree is empty or structurally malformed.
